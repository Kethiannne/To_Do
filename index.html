        Lets make a section similar to project 4's
      profile where you can add in a name and description
      for your to do list
        this section should have a different background color
      and should have a fixed position at the top of the page
      so you can scroll down without losing access to buttons
        the edit button should be here, as well as the add
      list item button and remove item one

      <!--
        Lets make a flex column or a single column grid
      here where list items can be added. making them use
      check boxes as their list style would be a good touch
      then we can make it so they lose opacity when checked

        we can add an overlay with another grid which lines up
      with the check boxes and adds another set of them for
      removal purposes

        the overlay itself should appear whenever you go to
      add a new item, or select which ones will be deleted
      the opacity should be much lower when selecting things
      for deletion
